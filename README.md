# Running the OS

So far it is unknown if this works on real hardware so we will use VMWare for this.
Download the ISO file and setup up a VMWare machine with
* 512 mb of memory
* 500 mb of hard disk space
* 1 processor

After that, it is recommened that you get [HAXM](https://github.com/intel/haxm/releases/tag/v7.8.0) for slighty better performence (if your PC supports it).
Do keep in mind that HAXM is no longer being supported as of Jaunary 28th, 2023 (which sucks).

# Final notes
This took really long to make, so I hope you would enjoy, also contributors would be amazing!
